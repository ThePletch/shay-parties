item edit logic
  description editing:
    * the event host can only edit requested items
    * people who submitted items to bring can edit their own items
  deletion:
    * the event host can delete any item
      * deleting an item someone has claimed prompts them to contact that person
    * people who submitted items can delete them. this should prompt them to notify the host.
  unclaiming:
    * only requested items can be unclaimed. submitted items can only be deleted.
  creation:
    * users can create a new signup item if:
      * they are signed up to attend the event (YES only)
      AND EITHER
        * the event allows guest submitted items
        * they are the host
    * guest submitted items are always automatically claimed by the submitter. they cannot currently request items from others.

show page
  * the signup context description should be marked to indicate it is a message from the host, not the system

form
  * you can't edit requests on the form. you can only edit signup logic. requests are edited on the main page
    * help text should indicate this to avoid confusion
  * the signup context fields should be collapsed unless a toggle button (which does not alter state directly, but does disable/enable the fields) is pressed
    * they should be visible on page load if a signup context object already exists

model logic:
  * allow destroying signup context
  * signup context destruction destroys signup sheet items for the event
    * because of this, require confirmation before marking signup context for destruction
