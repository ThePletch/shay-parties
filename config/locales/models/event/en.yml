      secret_event_help:
        Secret events don't appear on the home page unless someone has RSVPed - you'll need to send people the event link yourself for them to find it.
        This won't stop people who receive the link from giving it to others without your permission.
        You can find your secret events in the "Host > My Hosted Events" section in the navigation bar.
