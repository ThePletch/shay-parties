      secret_event_help:
        Secret events don't appear on the home page unless someone has RSVPed - you'll need to send people the event link yourself for them to find it.
        This won't stop people you send the link to from giving it to others without your permission.
        You can find your secret events in the "Host > My Hosted Events" section in the navigation bar.
      header_photo_help:
        Photos are scaled and cropped to full-screen width (1900px by 500px), so wide photos with a ~4:1 aspect ratio appear best.
        If you don't provide a photo, a default header photo will be used.
